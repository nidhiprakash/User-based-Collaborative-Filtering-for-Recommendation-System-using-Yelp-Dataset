# User-based-Collaborative-Filtering-for-Recommendation-System-using-Yelp-Dataset
Recommender systems are a relatively new technology that is commonly being used by e-commerce websites and streaming services among others, to predict user opinion about products. Using the Yelp Challenge Dataset and using User-Based Collaborative filtering algorithm, our system would evaluate the similarity metrics using the Pearson correlation coefficient and use records in the training set (train.csv) to predict the stars/ratings for users and businesses in the testing set (test.csv.) using weighted sum of other usersâ€™ ratings. Further, using the stars/ratings in testing data as the ground truth we evaluate the accuracy of our recommendation system using Root mean square error (RMSE) values that are calculated. Using the results of the project, one could build a recommendation system that could analyze the results to recommend to the businesses which particular set of users it should target for more profits.
